# CC Admin Team members

These should be high level and apply to all participants. Suggest for now we use same requirements as in proposals:

All CC Admin team members, existing and future, are expected to:

* Have 10+ hours per week available for CC Admin Team duties and meetings.
* Have solid experience with Project Catalyst
* Have a working knowledge of the Catalyst Circle and what it does
* Be willing to work on their own facilitation or secretary skills
* In skiing terms, this is a black diamond run. You might have challenges if you donâ€™t have the required skills and background in Catalyst.
* Each member also has the responsibility to:
* Regularly attend meetings every weeks (2-4 hours)
* Maintain an agile backlog list to track issues between meetings
* Review and comment on agenda issues, documents, and other materials ahead of time
* Learn and practice effective meeting procedures
* Attend training sessions focused on inclusive and lean startup leadership techniques
* Provide feedback on the effectiveness of the Admin Team and to each other
