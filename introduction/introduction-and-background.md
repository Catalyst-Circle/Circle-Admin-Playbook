# Introduction and Background

## Catalyst Circle:

Like the Catalyst Circle (CC) was born out of a need for communication between key stakeholder community groups within Catalyst, the CC Admin team was created to facilitate, track, and record interactions within the Circle itself. We strongly believe that this is the exact type of grassroots organizing and social development that Catalyst is designed for: a group of like-minded individuals identify a problem, band together, and work to solve that problem. By stepping up and fulfilling this role, the CC Admin team allows the elected Circle members more time to focus on finding solutions to community identified problems, rather than spending that time completing tasks which are administrative or operational in nature.
